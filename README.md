# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

For this website I created a study guide containing snippets of information regarding the building blocks of the internet: HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.  In doing so I've created a foundation for myself to build on throughout my education as a web developer.  

Compiling this information will make it easier to recall at later dates.  Also, this allows the user to keep all the details about what they have learned in one place.  This can prevent the user from being overwhelmed by large amounts of information, as well as saving the time it would take to comb back through course materials searching for instruction.

During the process, I learned much about the topics themselves, as well as how they interact with each other.  Additionally I now know the basics for coding, debugging, and deploying a website.

## Usage

On the site, each section contains some useful information about each of the four topics discussed during the prework modules for the coding bootcamp.  These are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.  You can also open the developer tools, and in the console it will list all the topics covered, as well as choose a random topic to start with.
